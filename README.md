## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - Front end Compiler

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at using **Svelte**. Having previously used **React** I was familiar with how to use frameworks, which allowed me to pick up its ideas relatively quickly. I still have a lot to learn, and am sure I made a lot of mistakes, but I'm happy with my first **Svelte** project.

### Continued development

-   Semantic HTML
-   Accessibility
-   BEM
-   Svelte

### Useful resources

-   [Svelte Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) - The Svelte website has a fantastic tutorial which runs through its concepts.
-   [Font-size clamp() Generator](https://clamp.font-size.app/) - As the name implies, a web app which generates responsive font sizes.
